# Welcome to "Strain Sensor" repository!

In this repository you will find scientific work involving capilar optical fibers (COFs) acting as strain sensors.

In the folder "E - 19", you have access to an optical spectrum data named "Band B - Data - Spectrum.TXT".
To process this spectrum, you can use "Strain Sensing.py". But before running the program, it is necessary to write the location of the folder which contains "E - 19" on "Path Manager.txt".
The "Band B - Table - Transverse Section.xlsx" sheet contain the thickness profile of the fiber and must be inside "E - 19".

A scientific paper about this repository analysis was published and can be accessed in
