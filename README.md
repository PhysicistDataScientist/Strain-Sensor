Subject: Capilar optical fibers (COFs) for strain sensing.

Objectives:
- Characterize the valleys on the near-infrared region of the spectrum;
- Study the thickness variation of the cladding thoroughly the fiber;
- Simulate the change in thickness and refractive index due to strain;
- Simulation the shift in a valley position due to strain.

Contents:
- "E - 19": folder corresponding to one sample;
  - "Band B - Data - Spectrum.TXT": .csv styled spectrum;
  - "Band B - Table - Transverse Section.xlsx": Excel sheet with the thickness profile of the sample;
- "Strain Sensing.py": Python code to run the analysis;
- "Path Manager.txt": file to contain the path location of the folder with all the sample folders.

Instructions:
1) Put "Path Manager.txt" in the same folder as "Strain Sensing.py";
2) Write the path of the folder containing "E - 19" on "Path Manager.txt";
3) Put the "Band B - Data - Spectrum.TXT" and "Band B - Table - Transverse Section.xlsx" inside "E - 19";
5) Run "Strain Sensing.py".
