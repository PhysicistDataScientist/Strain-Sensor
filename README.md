# Welcome to "Strain Sensor" repository!

Overview: Study on capilar optical fibers (COFs) acting as strain sensors.

Contents:
- "E - 19": folder corresponding to one sample;
  - "Band B - Data - Spectrum.TXT": .csv styled spectrum;
  - "Band B - Table - Transverse Section.xlsx": Excel sheet with the thickness profile of the sample;
- "Strain Sensing.py": Python code to run the analysis;
- "Path Manager.txt": file to contain the path location of the folder with all the sample folders.

Instructions:
1) Put "Path Manager.txt" in the same folder as "Hi-Bi Fiber.py";
2) Write the path of the folder containing "Experimental Set 1" on "Path Manager.txt";
3) Put the "E000X.txt" files and "Conversion Dictionary.xlsx" inside "Experimental Set 1";
4) Fill the "Conversion Dictionary.xlsx" "Name" column with the angles corresponding spectrum file names.  
5) Run "Hi-Bi Fiber.py".
