# Welcome to "Strain Sensor" repository!

In this repository you will find scientific work involving capilar optical fibers (COFs) acting as strain sensors.

In the folder "E - 17", you have access to an optical spectrum data named "Band C - Data - Spectrum.txt" and a summary of the experimental analysis called "Report.pdf".
To process this spectrum, you can use "Strain Sensing.py". But before running the program, it is necessary to write the location of the folder which contains "E - 17" on "Path Manager.txt".

A scientific paper about this repository analysis was published and can be accessed in
